​Texas Venture Group is partnering with c0mpiled (by Transpose Platform) to bring a fast-paced, build-first hackathon to the Forty Acres.

​c0mpiled is coming to UT Austin with a focused hackathon centered around energy, urban systems, and AI. As rising demand, extreme weather, and electrification strain power grids, Texas sits at the center of what comes next. In just a few hours, builders will use cutting-edge tools from leading startups to prototype what the future of AI-powered cities could look like.

​This is an execution-driven event designed for people who ship. Teams will work alongside experienced builders, with YC-backed founders on site to mentor, challenge ideas, and share firsthand insight into building real companies.
